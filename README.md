Created scripts to run PyBank and PyPoll.  

Scripts are titled:

-	PyBankMain.py
-	PyPollMain.py

PyBank
PyBank analyzes company financial records to determine total months analyzed, total revenue, average change, and the greatest increases and decreases in profit during the period analyzed.  The results of the analysis prints to the screen when run and also creates a text file named FinancialResultsFile.txt.

PyPoll
PyPoll analyzes election results to determine the total number of votes, the number of total votes accumulated by each candidate, and the election winner.  The results of the analysis prints to the screen when run and also creates a text file named ElectionResultsFile.txt.

Both output files are written to an Analysis directory when complete.

PyBank
Due to issues with running the file using csvpath=os.path.join('..','Resources','budget_data.csv'), the input files were pulled using the following language:  budget_data = os.path.join(r"/Users/marvinfontaine/Data-Analytics/Homework/python-challenge/PyBank/Resources/budget_data.csv").

PyPoll
Due to issues with running the file using csvpath=os.path.join('..','Resources','election_data.csv'), the input files were pulled using the following language: election_data = os.path.join(r"/Users/marvinfontaine/Data-Analytics/Homework/python-challenge/PyPoll/Resources/election_data.csv")

This project was quite challenging.  Much of these tasks were completed by working together and sharing ideas in study groups.
